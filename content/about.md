# Hey there! 👋 I'm Óscar

Welcome to my _Digital Atlantis_, where I basically post what I would normally do offline, for the sake of keeping track of things. I work as an SRE/DevOps but I'm also interested in personal finances and investing. In my free time you can find me doing Track & Field or shamelessly assaulting a sushi place for dinner 🍣.

I'd be more than happy to hear from you in case you have any feedback so here's my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-izquierdo-valentin/).
