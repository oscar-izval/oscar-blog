# Oscar's Blog

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my personal blog repository! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on various topics that interest me. Whether it's about technology, finances, or personal development, I aim to write pieces that are informative, engaging, and thought-provoking.

## Tools
The site is generated using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), a Static Site Generator which produces very light and fast websites. The theme I'm using is called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and is the main responsible for the site looking this clean and minimalistic.

## Note to my future self
Given my spontaneity writting these pieces, here is a list of useful things to remember when trying to work on a project:
- There is Nix support, su using Devenv should be enough to provision a working HUGO version.
- The theme can be updated following its documentation
- `hugo server` creates a local website
